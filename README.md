# Breakout RL Agent

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning agent designed to play the Atari game Breakout. The agent is built using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, with plans to explore enhancements like Double DQN. More to come.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a RL agent that can effectively learn and execute strategies to maximize its score in the Atari game Breakout. We use the Furama Foundation Gymnasium environment to simulate the game for training and evaluation.
