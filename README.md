# Breakout RL Agent

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning agent designed to play the Atari game Breakout. The agent is built using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, with plans to explore enhancements like Double DQN. More to come.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a RL agent that can effectively learn and execute strategies to maximize its score in the Atari games. I used the OpenAI Gymnasium environment to simulate the game for training and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CMvvvt/Breakout-DQN.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

### Note

NOTE: I haven't updated the tests for my latest code versions.
The test might fail running.
